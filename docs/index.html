        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
            This class uses labs based on Xamarin.Forms to demonstrate cross-platform capabilities on iOS, Android and Windows. 
            To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin development environment with either a simulator/emulator or a device to run the exercise on. 
            Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        This is the second of two classes on consuming web services in your mobile applications. This class covers consuming SOAP-based services with the built-in WCF network stack.
        </p>

        <div class="hintblock">
            <strong>Note:</strong> This class utilizes WCF which is only available in the business edition of the Xamarin tools. You must have a business license, or be running a trial in order to complete the exercises in this class. In addition, to generate the proxy code on your own, you will need access to a Windows machine with the Silverlight SDK. A sample proxy file is included with these materials if you do not have access to a Windows development machine.
